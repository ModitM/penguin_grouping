# penguin_grouping
### Problem statement
You have been asked to support a team of researchers who have been collecting data about penguins in Antartica! The data is available in csv-Format as 'penguins.csv'. The dataset consists of 5 columns having different metrics and sex of the penguins. Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are at least three species that are native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Your task is to apply your data science skills to help them identify groups in the dataset! Post-classification, statistical analysis may be done based on groups. Show this by determining the average values of each metric for each group.
